       " 'wow okay i sense an amazon com equivalent of an egging or a tp party coming on because if i am to honestly review demonfire it s not going to be nearly a flattering a the majority of other reviewer paranormal romance and urban fantasy are my two favorite book genre i read and i review a lot of them i ve come to realize that i m usually pretty forgiving of minor issue or singular issue for example if it s a decent story but not technically all that well told i may give it a three star but explain in my review what the critical aspect are i understand and accept that i hold my favorite genre to a higher standard rightly or wrongly than other genre and that ultimately i want to be entertained i believe that if i m not entertained given that the genre predisposes me to being entertained then there s a big problem somewhere i wa not entertained by demonfire my apology to kate douglas who i ve enjoyed a an erotic paranormal romance author but frankly i found the character in demonfire to be two dimensional and the narrative to be repetitive inexplicable and at time heavy handed eddy and dax seemed cardboard and flat and unfortunately so did the entire impetus behind their relationship the abrupt way they were thrown together felt too contrived and put a heavy strain on my suspension of disbelief not even dax could understand how he got into eddy s shed from the portal he came through so how could i when those issue combined with the perplexing mythology of the lemurians to explain altan s character and presence the first quarter of the book felt like a cross between a snore and a quagmire of implausibility to be honest the pitbull poodle mixed breed canine wa more fleshed out with a more believable and sympathetic backstory than two third of the book s main character and that s a problem dax is a former demon now reincarnated reanimated newly de demonized sorta former soldier boy with a tattoo on his body that will come back to bite him or try to again and again and again eddy is a human reporter who is willing to toss her job and fight demon she didn t even believe in yesterday no convincing and little to no explanation needed she find out her touch soothes dax s demonic curse with no explanation and little to no coherent reason given altan is the ancient lemurian who gave up his millennium old and immortal life in the cavern of a currently inactive volcano or other dimension i wasn t too clear on that could be both i suppose though i m not sure why the volcano would exist in both dimension the part of the story concerning that race and altan s decision wa anorexic in plot and very nebulous in the narrative and i had a big problem with altan s excellent grasp of modern american vernacular technology and cultural reference considering the written mythology toss in the dog bumper a will o wisp tinkerbell sort willow my favorite character through most of the book and ed eddy s father by far the most interesting and believable character and you have the core group that fight the big bad demon who really aren t so big or bad given that they re animating garden gnome and other kitschy lawn statuary except for the gargoyle but you ll have to read that for yourself the problem with the book aren t just in the character the world douglas is trying to create here never really snapped into solid focus for me too many shifting descriptives and inexplicable happenstance the book s main conflict the threat of the big bad and smaller baddie wa bizarrely non threatening you could ve had a no human were hurt during the writing of this book disclaimer and then there wa the repetition dax wa given a human sorta body for one week to fight the demon slipping from abyss after the protagonist get together the book count down the rest of dax s seven day and at some point in each one of those remaining day the fact he s only got six five four three two day left is given a lot of room in the story to explain in mind numbing detail just how sucky it is for all concerned that dax only ha that much time left and this melodrama went on each and every day over and over and over again repetitively i don t think that s compelling plot nor do i feel that it engenders any sense of true tension because a the reader i know going in that it s a paranormal romance and dax and eddy are going to get their hea otherwise it d be called shakespeare lamenting for page after page about them being separated for eternity just becomes tedious and dare i be repetitive repetitive i ve read excellent paranormal romance series that deal with this subject and it s always the ingenuity and originality of how the lead get their hea that impress me i already know they re going to so by the end when i wa at least hoping for a glimmer of originality in the way eddy and dax stay together i wa ultimately disappointed again i won t give spoiler but it wa just not well done so why the two star given how much it sound like i hated it because i didn t hate it maybe i wa too ambivalent about it to hate it maybe that s worse but mostly the two star are because there were a few tiny glimmer of hope kate douglas doe write reasonably sensual sex scene and what little chemistry there wa between dax and eddy shined brightest during them i think it s hard sometimes to go from writing erotic novel to toning down the sex for a mass market audience and i think that demonfire wa well represented in that regard i think some people are going to think it wa too graphic or explicit but i m not one of them i also sort of ended up liking altan i still don t get why he talked in such a modern and culturally human fashion but i thought he wa sort of endearing with the sword that refused to speak to him and the crush he get on ginny and that is why i will give kate douglas another chance the second book in this series is due out later this year and according to the sneak peak altan is off to sedona where he sent ginny to save her from what wa going on only to get a call that thing in sedona are even worse a live animal are being possessed by demon and attacking their owner and neighbor and the like and

forward when it is such a fundamental basis for the plot and such an obvious error it s really hard to suspend reality a the glaring mistake keep popping up again and again and again i don t think it is a spoiler for me to comment upon the fact that the female character pam wa fleeing for her life because she wa witness to a murder by a hit man that she had previously testified at his murder trial that he wa convicted but the guilty verdict had been overturned on a technicality we are never told what that wa and that there is going to be a retrial at which pam will have to testify all over again the hit man doesn t want her to testify again and think that if he can kill her before the retrial he will not be convicted for the original hit pam her lawyer the police and everyone else in the book seem to be operating under this same assumption the entire basis for this story trying to kill her to prevent her testifying at a retrial and therefore keeping the hit man from going to jail for the initial murder sound like a truly dangerous frightening possibility however the author ha blatantly disregarded one of the most important thing every young public defender wannabe learns in law school if a witness ha testified under oath in a prior judicial proceeding and if the same defendant had a meaningful opportunity to fully cross examine this witness in the prior court proceeding then if the witness becomes unavailable including beyond the reach of a u subpoena incapacitated by an illness or gee dead then that witness prior sworn testimony is admissible against that defendant in a subsequent judicial proceeding like for example a retrial the prior testimony will be read into evidence in the retrial and the jury will be instructed to accept that prior testimony a if the witness had been present and had given said testimony live in court there is no point to killing pam or to keeping her from testifying in any way a the hit man already had his day in court against her only the verdict in the first trial wa thrown out not any of the testimony in the case all of the evidence from the first trial including witness testimony document scientific test etc are still valid except insofar a the appellate court ruled on a specific item of evidence not being admissible and if the witness is present to testify in the retrial if she were to contradict her testimony from the first trial it could be used to impeach her retrial testimony during the retrial i e destroy her credibility for the retrial jury by showing how she ha changed her story without justification wa she lying then or is she lying now so if you are a stupid hit man trying to kill a witness who ha already given sworn testimony against you and you through your lawyer fully cross examined that witness that first time do not kill the witness to prevent them from testifying at a retrial you ll only be adding an unnecessary murder one charge to your resume i mean really how would our criminal justice system survive if the bad guy could just go around killing off witness to prevent them from testifying against them at a retrial criminal would set themselves up for a mistrial all along just so that they could force a retrial before which the key witness against them would mysteriously die one by one like an agatha christie tale it s not hard to slip a mickey into your lawyer s water at the counsel table sleeping through the trial would be definite ground for a mistrial or plant evidence that a juror misbehaved during the trial another solid basis for a retrial what witness would ever agree to testify in a murder case if the premise in this book wa plausible killing them before their initial trial testimony yes that could keep the bad guy from going to prison which is why the witness in serious mob crime are often hidden somewhere safe until they testify at trial once witness have testified under oath however that testimony will never just go away and it will always be potentially useable in a subsequent legal proceeding for different purpose depending upon the nature of that subsequent proceeding it s the ultimate permanent record for example if joe witness were to testify at the trial of a purse snatcher describing how he ran down the bad guy for half a mile leaping over bench and around moving car then that testimony could be used by an employer in a case against joe witness who had been collecting worker s comp for a back injury suffered year before on the job and that joe had claimed kept him in constant pain and virtually wheelchair bound or if joe witness were to file a claim against a driver for hitting him while he ran down said purse snatcher the driver could then use joe s testimony at the criminal trial to prove that joe had leaped out of nowhere and that it wa joe s fault he wa hit or at least it wa not the driver s and joe witness would be unable to blatantly contradict his prior testimony a it wa the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help him insert appropriate higher power here just looking out for all the innocent murder witness out there now if the hit man want to kill the witness out of revenge after he is convicted that s another story',\n",
